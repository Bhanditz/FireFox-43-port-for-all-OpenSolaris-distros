@@@@@UPDATE@@@@@: Flash Plugin 9/10/11.x 
... works now inside this gcc compiled Firefox!
That was a complete Novum when I reached this step in April. This took another tough week
of work night and day and night.
Nobody has ever achieved this before with a gcc build of FF on Solaris (at least nobody in the records and nobody who offered to donate this to the broader planet OpenSolaris).
From the src it appears that this must also affect other UNIX/LinUX OS ports, but I never tested this.


It was tested and is known to work with:
(instabilities and freezes related to videos that are in a too new format can always happen, but are not related to this port, while flash is closed src and I can only take their bins and make them work in FF as good as technically possible)

Attention: On all newer Illumos based Distros _except_ OpenSXCE you probably need some loading order
nonsense to get the Flash-Plugin 11.x initializing itself rather than crashing (only works sometimes, not with all codecs). 
In such cases you should remove your local libflashplayer.so from the plugins directory and set HTML5 as your default player (e.g. on youtube).
But that drmatically reduces compatibility and rather often you cannot watch a news or music video. Because ... : HTML5 nice and good, but often they still force use to use flash.

Note: if you have no 335 MB space in /usr it can be placed onto _any_ filesystem, as long as you create a symlink pointing to the new location as /usr/lib/firefox43.0b3 (mandatory)



WHERE IS THE PLUGINS INSTALL DIR:

Global location: /usr/lib/firefox43.0b3/plugins (symlink) or /usr/lib/firefox43.0b3/lib/firefox-43.0/browser/plugins
Because by definition, given that I frequently want to test different flash plugins for testing, I always use ~/firefox/plugins which works.
To verify which plugins got recognized open FF and enter the special URL:   about:plugins
Don't forget that Flash will crash on Illumos kernels except on OpenSXCE (which is the only one with a kernel fix).



USAGE:

FF43.0b3 can be started in 3 different ways, either of the following ...

$ /usr/bin/firefox43.0b3

$ /usr/lib/firefox43.0b3/bin/firefox

or under JDS/Gnome from {Start}->{All Applications}->{Internet}->{Firefox 43.0b3 Beta}



UNINSTALL:
# pkgrm SUNWfirefox43-0b3




SVR4 NOTES:

Normally one could have split this into 95 dedicated packages (one for each locale and then for bookmarks, etc) and could have created a sophisticated set of depend files for them, defining dependencies and interdependencies.
HOWEVER: I like simplicity, openness, clarity and user-friendliness. Therefore it comes all in a single package and hence in a click and go experience.
Also - as I rarely if ever used IPS in my life I don't know if depend files to non-existant packages can be easily overridden on Sun Indiana derived distros, never tried. But I think such things can be tricky there. As the audience of these packages are Solaris professionals, rather than XP clickers, I assume every user knows that his installation needs more than just a OS/Net install cluster. Therefore I did not define any depend file at all (as I see Sun/Oracle does the same for its FF ESR packages).

Nevertheless, for the records, here the list of SUNWfirefox* packages that would have been created from this in the old times and also a depend file.
NOTE: For audio support no extra dependency is required, as I borrowed Sun's audio code from their diffs.
NOTE#2: The gcc4 runtime is bundled and doesn't need to be present on the system (no gcc/gcc-runtime must be installed via any separate pkgs).
For java I recommend a userland-compiled openjdk7.


Here the legacy SVR4 pkgadd SUNW* names:

SUNWfirefox-devel
SUNWfirefoxl10n-de-DE

Final explanation: As mentioned the binary package/tarball available at http://opensxce.org/.FF/43.0b3/i386/ was created to run on EVERY OpenSolaris/Solaris11/Solaris12/Illumos derived distro out of the box.
Therefore it was compiled on old Sun SXCE snv_130. There I didn't want to go though the hassle to bootstrap the much newer userland until finally a newer gcc like 4.7 or 4.8 builds fine. Also I wanted to be userfriendly again: For best interdistro-operability I took something which everybody can install in 5 minutes, no matter on which distro he lives. That's why the choice fell for OpenCSW's/Blastwave's gcc4.9!
And its runtime is also the one that I henceforth chose for includion in the binary enduser-packages.
In a hurry I installed Hipster April 2015 Edition in self-compiled Vbox from the opensxce-userland to verify if it runs out of the box, result: Yes.
Only bug I saw so far: The loudspeaker symbol for tabs (new FF feature!) does not change the volume, neither if it contains a video played in html5 nor flash.
But now I confirmed that on snv_130 and on OpenSXCE2014.05 it is the same (maybe it also affaects non-Solaris OS's and has nothing to do with my port). We can look into that later - it has a low priority on my agenda. Because the workaround is simple: Use /usr/bin/gnome-volmume-control as until now, and you want to mute a tab, click the [pause] button in the html5 or adobe player.

p.s. The OpenIndiana Flash-test page should be updated to point to another test video (see http://opensxce.org/.FF/43.0b3/i386/demo_screenshots/).
Youtube now defaults to html5 where-ever possible.
